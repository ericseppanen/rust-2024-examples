# Upgrading to Rust 2024

This repository contains examples of Rust code that will be affected by an upgrade to the 2024 edition.
`Cargo.toml` contains lints that can be enabled to reveal (and fix) issues one at a time.

The examples and lints work on rust 2021, but a beta or nightly compiler will be needed if you actually want to try the 2024 edition before the 1.85 toolchain is released on February 20, 2025.
